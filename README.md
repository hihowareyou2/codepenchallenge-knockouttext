# codepenchallenge-knockouttext
This was created as part of the CodePen weekly challenges for November (Week 3).

Here's is a description of the challenge, found here: https://codepen.io/challenges/2021/november/


"Last week, the CodePen community added some typographic charm to a simple set of menu cards. Peruse the tasty selections from week two in our #CodePenChallenge: Card Text collection.

This week, let's knock out some Knockout Text!

The "knockout" style, sometimes known as "cutout" text, is when text "knocks out" holes in an element to reveal the background. The knocked out text usually reveals a color, an image, or sometimes even more text.

This week's template includes a short phrase in a nice thick font (Modak from Google Fonts). But the rest is up to you! The chunky typeface we chose gives you plenty of surface area to knock out. But, feel free to swap out the font, change the phrase, or knock down the whole template and start over from scratch."


I decided to use CSS animated gradients to try different effects, my pen can be found here: https://codepen.io/hihowareyou2/pen/oNeQKGP

I had lots of fun messing around with different settings to get different results.
